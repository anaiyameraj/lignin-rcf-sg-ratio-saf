# Influence of S/G Ratios on Product Distribution in Catalytic Fractionation of Grass Stover
### Methodology Development for Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production

**Affiliation:** University of Washington, Department of Chemical Engineering  
**Collaborators:** UW ChemE & University of Missouri  
**Research Area:** Biomass Valorization, Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF)


## Project Overview
This undergraduate research project investigates how the **syringyl-to-guaiacyl (S/G) ratio** in lignin derived from grass stover influences the **distribution of reaction products** formed during **reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF)**.

The project focuses on **methodology development, reactor safety, and experimental reproducibility** to support future work aimed at producing **aromatic fuel precursors** suitable for sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs).


## Motivation
The aviation industry contributes approximately **2–3.5% of global CO₂ emissions**, motivating the development of renewable alternatives to petroleum-based jet fuels.

Lignin, a major component of lignocellulosic biomass, can be catalytically depolymerized into **aromatic compounds** that align with jet fuel blendstock requirements. However, lignin structure varies by feedstock—particularly in the relative abundance of **syringyl (S)** and **guaiacyl (G)** units—which can significantly influence reaction pathways and product distributions during RCF.

Understanding these structure–property relationships is critical for designing biomass feedstocks optimized for fuel production.


## Research Objective
The primary objective of this project was to:

> **Determine how variations in lignin S/G ratios affect the distribution of solid, liquid, and gaseous products formed during reductive catalytic fractionation of grass stover.**

To enable meaningful comparisons, this work emphasized establishing a **standardized experimental and safety framework** prior to large-scale comparative studies.


## Methodology

### Reaction Conditions
- **Feedstock:** Grass stover (~30 wt% lignin)
- **Catalyst:** Ru/C (5 wt%, 0.15 g)
- **Solvent:** Methanol (50 mL)
- **Gas:** Hydrogen (30 bar)
- **Temperature:** 250 °C
- **Time:** 3 hours
- **Agitation:** 400 RPM
- **Reactor:** Parr high-pressure batch reactor


### SOP Development
A major contribution of this work was the development of a **standard operating procedure (SOP)** for lignin RCF reactions. The SOP:
- Standardizes reactor setup and operation
- Documents replacement parts, cleaning procedures, and safety hazards
- Enables **reproducibility and consistency** across samples and collaborators

This SOP supports cross-institutional research and long-term scalability of experimental workflows.


### Safety & Thermodynamic Analysis
Safety calculations were performed to estimate worst-case pressure and temperature scenarios under different assumptions:

**Isothermal Case (250 °C, full methanol conversion):**
- Peng–Robinson EOS: ~224 bar  
- NRTL: ~212 bar  
- SRK: ~228 bar  

**Adiabatic Case (no heat exchange):**
- Predicted temperatures >700 °C  
- Pressures exceeding 400 bar  

These analyses informed reactor operation limits and motivated **catalyst passivation strategies** (RuO₂ layer formation) to reduce combustion risk.

## Analytical Methods
Reaction products were separated and analyzed across all phases:

- **Gas:** GC–MS  
- **Liquid:** GC–MS, NMR, GPC, UV–Vis, DSC  
- **Solid:** Mass balance and compositional analysis  

This workflow enables detailed tracking of aromatic monomers and fuel-relevant compounds produced during RCF.

## Key Results (Methodology Phase)
- Developed and validated a standardized SOP for lignin RCF reactions
- Conducted uncatalyzed trial reactions to benchmark system behavior

## Future Work
- Conduct RCF reactions using **mutated lignin samples** with controlled S/G ratios
- Quantify how S/G ratio affects product distribution
- Identify optimal S/G thresholds for producing **C₆–C₁₆ aromatic fuel precursors**
- Support bioengineering efforts to tailor lignin composition toward desired products
